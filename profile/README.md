## Welcome to  EUHubs4Data Ethics 👋

We started as the ethics monitoring group a large scale 🇪🇺 European Union funded project [EUHubs4Data](https://euhubs4data.eu/ethics/). We monitored 42 data innovation experiments on ethical risks. As we progressed we realized a big gap between theory and reality in data experimentation (particularly AI).
While new regulations are coming in (AI Act, Data Act) small median enterprises still struggle with basic compliance with data protection regulation. This has an immediate impact on the implementation of ethics. Companies, but also hubs like the i-Spaces of the BDVA are easily overwhelmed. 

🥅 Our goal is to assemble a group of people that want to put data innovation back on basic ethical fundamentals by offering basic tooling for basic compliance, but opening the scope to present and upcoming challenges around data innovation and its impact on individuals, society and the environment.

So you innovator can both be sure that they have ⚖️"the right to do things" and 🌈"do things right".

We are here to learn to together and establish standards for future data spaces, experimentation platforms, ....
